# **Bridging Language Models and Computational Chemistry: A Prompt-Driven Framework for Material Property Prediction**

MatAgent is an intelligent agent designed to enhance molecular property prediction by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with first-principles (FP) calculations. Unlike traditional LLMs, which often struggle with chemistry-related tasks due to limited access to specialized knowledge, MatAgent leverages advanced chemical tools to provide accurate, efficient predictions of molecular properties.

## Install dependencies
